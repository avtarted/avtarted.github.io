	<h1>Hello Stalker</h1>

	<h2>Bio</h2>
	<p>
	My name is Ted Avtar. 
	I graduated from UC Berkeley with a double major in Computer Science and Molecular Cell Biology in 2015 and, more recently, I've created <a href="https://bumpercoins.io/" target="_blank">BumperCoins</a>, a neat online multiplayer game.
	I like reading SciFi and math-intensive textbooks and running(slowly) and badminton.
